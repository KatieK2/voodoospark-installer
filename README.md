# voodoospark-installer

Installs voodoospark from the command line, so you don't have to use the Particle IDE.

## Installation

`npm install -g voodoospark-installer`

## Usage

Don't use this until you've created a Particle login (it makes you create one when you claim a device.)

It'll ask for your username and password, then ask which device you want to flash voodoospark to.
